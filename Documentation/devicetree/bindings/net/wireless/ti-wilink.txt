TI WiLink Wireless Modules Device Tree Bindings
===============================================

The WiLink modules provide wireless connectivity, such as WLAN,
Bluetooth, FM and NFC.

There are several different modules available, which can be grouped by
their generation: WiLink6, WiLink7 and WiLink8.  WiLink4 is not
currently supported with device tree.

Currently, only the WLAN portion of the modules is supported with
device tree.

Required properties:
--------------------

- compatible: should be "ti,wilink6", "ti,wilink7" or "ti,wilink8"
- interrupt-parent: the interrupt controller
- interrupts: out-of-band WLAN interrupt
	See the interrupt controller's bindings documentation for
	detailed definition.

Optional properties:
--------------------

- clocks: list of clocks needed by the chip as follows:

  refclock: the internal WLAN reference clock frequency (required for
	WiLink6 and WiLink7; not used for WiLink8).

  tcxoclock: the internal WLAN TCXO clock frequency (required for
	WiLink7 not used for WiLink6 and WiLink8).

  The clocks must be defined and named accordingly.  For example:

  clocks = <&refclock>
  clock-names = "refclock";

  refclock: refclock {
		     compatible = "ti,wilink-clock";
		     #clock-cells = <0>;
		     clock-frequency = <38400000>;
	};

  Some modules that contain the WiLink chip provide clocks in the
  module itself.  In this case, we define a "ti,wilink-clock" as shown
  above.  But any other clock could in theory be used, so the proper
  clock definition should be used.


Example:
--------

Example definition that can be used in OMAP4 Panda:

wlan {
	compatible = "ti,wilink6";
	interrupt-parent = <&gpio2>;
	interrupts = <21 0x4>;	/* gpio line 53, high level triggered */
	clocks = <&refclock>;
	clock-names = "refclock";

	refclock: refclock {
		compatible = "ti,wilink-clock";
		#clock-cells = <0>;
		clock-frequency = <38400000>;
	};
};
